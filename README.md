# Sentiment-Analysis---Python

Analyzing and Tracking the Sentiment and 
Topics on Social Media:

Being an employee of Easy Analytics, I have assigned to analyze the sentiment and topics in social media of a 
reputed singer in the world known as “Katy Perry”. Katy Perry is an American singer, songwriter, and 
television judge. She uses social media to be connected with her fans worldwide. She is very interested to 
know what her followers are saying about her online what their feeling are towards image.
Since she is a celebrity there are always tweets about her and she has the most followers in the world 
followed by Justin Bieber and Barak Obama.
Lately, she has become one of the judges in American Idol and there are lot of good or bad comments about 
her in the twitter. So, my role will be analyzing sentiment and also have to do topic modelling collecting 
tweets from her account.
